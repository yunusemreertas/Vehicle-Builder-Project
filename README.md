## Description
The Vehicle Builder Project is a command-line application written in TypeScript that allows users to create and interact with vehicles such as Cars, Trucks, and Motorbikes. Users can create new vehicles, select existing ones, and perform various actions such as starting, accelerating, decelerating, towing other vehicles (for trucks), and performing a wheelie (for motorbikes). This project demonstrates class inheritance, interfaces, and user interaction through the Inquirer package.
